A practice application
Use HeWeather+Kotlin+MVP+AndroidX etc.

Use smarttablayout to show multiple cities , use transition animation to provide a better experience , flexbox is used to show
the selected cities , also you can remove the cities you won't concern directly , MMKV is used to store the cities you selected,
thanks to all these opensource projects and their authors !

Use HeWeather as the source of Weather info , thanks!
And thanks to https://github.com/git-xuhao/KotlinMvp and https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture , where I study from
